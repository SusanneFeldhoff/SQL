# SQL Advanced

 ## Summary
In this project I wsolved advanced SQL challenges in MySQL getting a broader sense of what is  possible with SQL.
 
 ## Languages and Libraries Used
SQL : Subquery, CTE, Temporary Table, Window Functions, Stored Views, Stored Procedured and Stored Functions
 
 ## Key Learnings
After an intense Python phase in Data Engineering I questioned myself why employers are always so see SQL experiences. Until this point I thought of SQL usage for setting up a relational database only. Now I changed my mind am very excited about the possibilities I was introduced to during the past weeks. Each concept it quite challenging by itself and in sum super complex to an unexperienced user like I was. But bit by bit I fought through each and most of the time ended up with a successfull outcome.
 
 ## Challenges Overcame
 Coming from Python I needed to reset my brain which took a few exercises. From one challenge to the next I slowly got back into the SQL Coding Logic. The mistake I made most often was that I referred to aliases that I could not call upon as they are not like Python's variables. Also I faced a lot of issues with window functions, e.g. to use partition by and/or order by especially when combined with group by. That said I am optimistic that further practise will make it easier by the time. German saying: "Bisher ist kein Meister vom Himmel gefallen."

 
 ## Additional Reflections
I am curious to see which laguage I will end up feeling more comfortable working with. Now I got a taste of both Python and SQL with their advantages and disadvantages, and Iam curious to taste more.
